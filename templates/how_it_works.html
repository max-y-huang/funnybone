        <h3>Funniness Scoring</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            FunnyBone uses AI to determine the funniness of a word. It starts
            off with a human reference point (i.e. a set of words whose
            funniness scores were manually marked), then it extrapolates this
            data using linear regression, a machine learning model, to predict
            the funniness of any arbitrary word. The predictions are then stored
            in a database for quick retrieval when needed.

        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            What words to predict? The set of words comes from Datamuse.
            Incidentally, FunnyBone uses
            <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api/" target="_blank"
              >Datamuse's public API</a
            >
            to find words that are semantically related to the user's prompt
            &mdash; the API and the database have the same vocabulary, so all
            possible outputs are given a funiness score.

            The funniness scoring borrows ideas from
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02783" target="_blank">
              Cockamamie Gobbledegook for Nincompoops</a
            >, a NLP research paper.

        <h3>Web App Interactions</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            The back-end for FunnyBone is a Flask app. When the page is loaded,
            the app reads the user's prompt from the URL query string. Then it
            finds candidate outputs using the aforementioned Datamuse API and
            retrieves their funniness scores from the database. The 3 funniest
            words, along with the unfunniest word, are noted.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            All necessary information is passed on to the front-end, an HTML
            page generated through Jinja2 templating. When the user enters a
            prompt, the page is reloaded with the new prompt reflected in the
            query string, repeating the cycle.
