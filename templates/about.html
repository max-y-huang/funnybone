        <h3>What Is FunnyBone?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            FunnyBone is an AI-powered humour search engine &mdash; it uses
            machine learning to find funny and unfunny words that are
            semantically similar to the given prompt. You can use it in many
            ways: creating attention-grabbing headlines, setting a lighthearted
            mood for a presentation, or simply adding humour to your writing.
            Whatever the context, FunnyBone can help you brainstorm ideas.

        <h3>How FunnyBone Came To Be</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            FunnyBone originated as a tech demo for a humour-sorting feature I
            implemented while working at Datamuse. Written under the MIT license
            (alongside permission from my boss), I gave the demo a new user
            interface, which I released as FunnyBone. The finalized version of
            the humour-sorting feature is in
            <a href="https://onelook.com/thesaurus" target="_blank"
              >OneLook Thesaurus</a
            >, which offers more advanced usage of the FunnyBone feature set
            (along with other cool features).

        <h3>Credits</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="hl">
            To rank the words by their funniness, I used techniques discussed in
            the NLP paper:
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02783" target="_blank">
              Cockamamie Gobbledegook for Nincompoops</a
            >. Doug Beeferman, my boss at
            <a href="https://datamuse.com" target="_blank">Datamuse</a>, guided
            me and pointed me towards the resources I needed to complete this
            project.</span
